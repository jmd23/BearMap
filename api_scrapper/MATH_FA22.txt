Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures that arise in a variety of areas, particularly in other areas of mathematics, computer science, and many areas of application.

An introduction to topological K-theory and characteristic classes. Topological K-theory is a generalized cohomology theory which is surprisingly simple and useful for computation while still containing enough structure for proving interesting results. The class will begin with the definition of K-theory, Chern classes, and the Chern character. Additional topics may include the Hopf invariant 1 problem, the J-homomorphism, Stiefel-Whitney classes and Pontrjagin classes, cobordism groups and the construction of exotic spheres, and the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.

MATH 6710: Probability Theory I
A mathematically rigorous course in probability theory which uses measure theory but begins with the basic definitions of independence and expected value in that context. Law of large numbers, Poisson and central limit theorems, and random walks.
Credits: 4
Semesters Offered: Fall.
Pre/Corequisites: Prerequisite: knowledge of Lebesgue integration theory, at least on real line. Students can learn this material by taking parts of MATH 4130-MATH 4140 or MATH 6210.

MATH 6740: Mathematical Statistics II
Focuses on the foundations of statistical inference, with an emphasis on asymptotic methods and the minimax optimality criterion. In the first part, the solution of the classical problem of justifying Fisher's information bound in regular statistical models will be presented. This solution will be obtained applying the concepts of contiguity, local asymptotic normality and asymptotic minimaxity. The second part will be devoted to nonparametric estimation, taking a Gaussian regression model as a paradigmatic example. Key topics are kernel estimation and local polynomial approximation, optimal rates of convergence at a point and in global norms, and adaptive estimation. Optional topics may include irregular statistical models, estimation of functionals and nonparametric hypothesis testing.

MATH 7740: Statistical Learning Theory: Classification, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning
The course aims to present the developing interface between machine learning theory and statistics. Topics include an introduction to classification and pattern recognition; the connection to nonparametric regression is emphasized throughout. Some classical statistical methodology is reviewed, like discriminant analysis and logistic regression, as well as the notion of perception which played a key role in the development of machine learning theory. The empirical risk minimization principle is introduced, as well as its justification by Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds. In addition, convex majoring loss functions and margin conditions that ensure fast rates and computable algorithms are discussed. Today's active high-dimensional statistical research topics such as oracle inequalities in the context of model selection and aggregation, lasso-type estimators, low rank regression and other types of estimation problems of sparse objects in high-dimensional spaces are presented.
