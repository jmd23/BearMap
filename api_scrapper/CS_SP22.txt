Introductory Design and Programming for the Web
The World Wide Web is both a technology and a pervasive and powerful resource in our society and culture. To build functional and effective web sites, students need technical and design skills as well as analytical skills for understanding who is using the web, in what ways they are using it, and for what purposes. In this course, students develop skills in all three of these areas through the use of technologies such as XHTML, Cascading Stylesheets, and PHP. Students study how web sites are deployed and used, usability issues on the web, user-centered design, and methods for visual layout and information architecture. Through the web, this course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of information science.

Choices and Consequences in Computing
Computing requires difficult choices that can have serious implications for real people. This course covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information. It draws on recent developments in digital technology and their impact on society, situating these in the context of fundamental principles from computing, policy, ethics, and the social sciences. A particular emphasis will be placed on large areas in which advances in computing have consistently raised societal challenges: privacy of individual data; fairness in algorithmic decision-making; dissemination of online content; and accountability in the design of computing systems. As this is an area in which the pace of technological development raises new challenges on a regular basis, the broader goal of the course is to enable students to develop their own analyses of new situations as they emerge at the interface of computing and societal interests.

Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a ubiquitous technology. This course, which is a follow up to an introductory course on ML will cover topics that aim to provide a theoretical foundation for designing and analyzing ML algorithms. This course has three basic blocks. First block will provide basic mathematical and statistical toolset required for formalizing ML problems effectively and analyzing them. This block will include topics like generalization, sample complexity of learning algorithm and understanding the inherent challenges in various ML frameworks and models. The second block will provide the foundations in algorithms design and optimization techniques required for building and analyzing various ML algorithms. This block will cover topics like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, algorithm design for online learning and computational challenges in ML. ML algorithms are deployed in real world and make decisions that affect real world users. The third block, will cover topics on how to formally reason about and how to design ML methods that address social and user related concerns that ML algorithms need to deal with. This block will cover topics such as fairness, privacy, the right to be forgotten and other such issues and how to build ML algorithms that address or assuage these concerns.
